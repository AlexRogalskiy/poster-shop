- Global useEffect : Add an entry in the FAQ about that, and maybe tell about global useEffect on layout part of Admin doc?
- SearchInput or TextInput? In the tutorial and in the doc both are used for fulltext search.
- Maybe add in the TextField doc a link to the FunctionField, to compose the field with 2 sources? The question I asked myself was "Ok, I want an TextField with 2 sources... how do I do that?"
