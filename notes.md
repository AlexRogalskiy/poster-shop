- Global useEffect : Add an entry in the FAQ about that, and maybe tell about global useEffect on layout part of Admin doc?
- SearchInput or TextInput? In the tutorial and in the doc both are used for fulltext search.
- Maybe add in the TextField doc a link to the FunctionField, to compose the field with 2 sources? The question I asked myself was "Ok, I want an TextField with 2 sources... how do I do that?"
- attribut sortBy sur ReferenceField : la doc laisse entendre qu'on peut filtrer sur un champ d'une référence. peut être préciser cette limitation.

- "Labeled" use was hard to find, It is mentioned in the [Input doc](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/Inputs.html#using-labeled), but not in the Field doc, and I was confused by that.

- use ReferenceField on nested object
